You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: C:\Users\mathi\Desktop\Mythical\SvelteKit
Blind packet: C:\Users\mathi\Desktop\Mythical\SvelteKit\.desloppify\review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 6
Batch name: abstraction_fitness
Batch rationale: abstraction_fitness review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## abstraction_fitness
TypeScript abstraction fitness: type and interface layers should improve safety and design clarity, not add ceremony or pass-through indirection.
Look for:
- Functions/components that only forward props or args without behavior, validation, or translation
- Interfaces/types with one implementation and no polymorphic usage pressure
- Large option objects passed through multiple layers with only a small subset used locally
- Generic helper abstractions with one concrete type usage in practice
- Cross-feature chains of wrappers that pass data unchanged between controller/service/helper layers
- Widespread one-implementation interface ecosystems that add naming ceremony without substitution value
Skip:
- React/Next.js framework composition patterns required by routing or lifecycle boundaries
- Wrappers that intentionally add auth, telemetry, caching, feature flags, or retries
- Public API typing shells that isolate external SDK volatility
- Intentional barrel/facade exports that define stable package entry points

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Previously flagged issues — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
Check whether open issues still exist. Do not re-report resolved or deferred items.
If several past issues share a root cause, call that out.

  Still open (2):
    - [open] 4 event handlers share identical request validation, token fetch, error handling - only query template differs
    - [open] GraphQL query construction repeated across handlers; no shared template

  Resolved (1):
    - [wontfix] Identical token request/expiry logic in oauth.ts and blizzardOauth.ts (note: Stale anchor or already addressed in this session: see Coverage Ledger in reflect report (.desloppify/reflect_report.txt).)

Explore past review issues:
  desloppify show review --no-budget              # all open review issues
  desloppify show review --status deferred         # deferred issues

RELEVANT FINDINGS — explore with CLI:
These detectors found patterns related to this dimension. Explore the findings,
then read the actual source code.

  desloppify show facade --no-budget      # 1 findings
  desloppify show single_use --no-budget      # 5 findings
  desloppify show structural --no-budget      # 1 findings

Report actionable issues in issues[]. Use concern_verdict and concern_fingerprint
for findings you want to confirm or dismiss.

Phase 1 — Observe:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — scoring rules and calibration.
2. Study the dimension rubric (description, look_for, skip).
3. Review the existing characteristics list — which are settled? Which are positive? What needs updating?
4. Explore the codebase freely. Use scan evidence, historical issues, and mechanical findings as navigation aids.
5. Adjudicate mechanical concern signals (confirm/dismiss with fingerprint).
6. Augment the characteristics list via context_updates: positive patterns (positive: true), neutral characteristics, design insights.
7. Collect defects for issues[].
8. Respect scope controls: exclude files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
9. Output a Phase 1 summary: list ALL characteristics for this dimension (existing + new, mark [+] for positive) and all defects collected. This is your consolidated reference for Phase 2.

Phase 2 — Judge (after Phase 1 is complete):
10. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
11. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
12. For abstraction_fitness, use evidence from `holistic_context.abstractions`:
13. - `delegation_heavy_classes`: classes where most methods forward to an inner object — entries include class_name, delegate_target, sample_methods, and line number.
14. - `facade_modules`: re-export-only modules with high re_export_ratio — entries include samples (re-exported names) and loc.
15. - `typed_dict_violations`: TypedDict fields accessed via .get()/.setdefault()/.pop() — entries include typed_dict_name, violation_type, field, and line number.
16. - `complexity_hotspots`: files where mechanical analysis found extreme parameter counts, deep nesting, or disconnected responsibility clusters.
17. Include `delegation_density`, `definition_directness`, and `type_discipline` alongside existing sub-axes in dimension_notes when evidence supports it.
18. Complete `dimension_judgment`: write dimension_character (synthesizing characteristics and defects) then score_rationale. Set the score LAST.
19. Output context_updates with your Phase 1 observations. Use `add` with a clear header (5-10 words) and description (1-3 sentences focused on WHY, not WHAT). Positive patterns get `positive: true`. New insights can be `settled: true` when confident. Use `settle` to promote existing unsettled insights. Use `remove` for insights no longer true. Omit context_updates if no changes.
20. Do not edit repository files.
21. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
