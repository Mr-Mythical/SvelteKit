You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: C:\Users\mathi\Desktop\Mythical\SvelteKit
Blind packet: C:\Users\mathi\Desktop\Mythical\SvelteKit\.desloppify\review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 3
Batch name: convention_outlier
Batch rationale: convention_outlier review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## convention_outlier
Naming convention drift, inconsistent file organization, style islands
Look for:
- Naming convention drift: snake_case functions in a camelCase codebase or vice versa
- Inconsistent file organization that impedes navigation (not mere structural variation between dirs)
- Mixed export patterns across sibling modules (named vs default, class vs function)
- Style islands: one directory uses a completely different pattern than the rest
- Sibling modules following different behavioral protocols (e.g. most call a shared function, one doesn't)
- Inconsistent plugin organization: sibling plugins structured differently
- Large __init__.py re-export surfaces that obscure internal module structure
- Mixed type strategies for domain objects (TypedDict for some, dataclass for others, NamedTuple for yet others) without documented rationale — see type_strategy_census evidence
Skip:
- Intentional variation for different module types (config vs logic)
- Third-party code or generated files following their own conventions
- Do NOT recommend adding index/barrel files, re-export facades, or directory wrappers to 'standardize' — prefer the simpler existing pattern over consistency-for-its-own-sake
- When sibling modules use different structures, report the inconsistency but do NOT suggest adding abstraction layers to unify them

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

RELEVANT FINDINGS — explore with CLI:
These detectors found patterns related to this dimension. Explore the findings,
then read the actual source code.

  desloppify show boilerplate_duplication --no-budget      # 25 findings
  desloppify show signature --no-budget      # 1 findings

Report actionable issues in issues[]. Use concern_verdict and concern_fingerprint
for findings you want to confirm or dismiss.

Phase 1 — Observe:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — scoring rules and calibration.
2. Study the dimension rubric (description, look_for, skip).
3. Review the existing characteristics list — which are settled? Which are positive? What needs updating?
4. Explore the codebase freely. Use scan evidence, historical issues, and mechanical findings as navigation aids.
5. Adjudicate mechanical concern signals (confirm/dismiss with fingerprint).
6. Augment the characteristics list via context_updates: positive patterns (positive: true), neutral characteristics, design insights.
7. Collect defects for issues[].
8. Respect scope controls: exclude files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
9. Output a Phase 1 summary: list ALL characteristics for this dimension (existing + new, mark [+] for positive) and all defects collected. This is your consolidated reference for Phase 2.

Phase 2 — Judge (after Phase 1 is complete):
10. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
11. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
12. For convention_outlier, also consult `holistic_context.conventions.duplicate_clusters` for cross-file function duplication and `conventions.naming_drift` for directory-level naming inconsistency.
13. Complete `dimension_judgment`: write dimension_character (synthesizing characteristics and defects) then score_rationale. Set the score LAST.
14. Output context_updates with your Phase 1 observations. Use `add` with a clear header (5-10 words) and description (1-3 sentences focused on WHY, not WHAT). Positive patterns get `positive: true`. New insights can be `settled: true` when confident. Use `settle` to promote existing unsettled insights. Use `remove` for insights no longer true. Omit context_updates if no changes.
15. Do not edit repository files.
16. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
