		<h1 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">About Mr. Mythical</h1>

		<p class="mb-6">
			Welcome to MrMythical.com, a passion project born from the desire to elevate World of Warcraft
			gameplay through better tools and analytics. As an active player and developer, I created this
			platform to provide the community with clean, efficient, and reliable utilities for both
			Mythic+ and raid content.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Our Tools</h2>
		<ul class="mb-6 ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
			<li>
				<strong>Mythic+ Rating Calculator:</strong> Plan your key pushing strategy and understand exactly
				how different dungeons impact your overall score
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Keystone Tooltip Addon:</strong> Get instant score predictions and gear drops without
				alt-tabbing, seamlessly integrated into your gameplay
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Encounter Healing Analyzer:</strong> Visualize raid healing, damage taken and abilities
				used during encounters, helping you optimize your raids healing strategy
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Average Damage Taken:</strong> Using data from Warcraft Logs, this tool helps you understand
				how much damage your raid typically takes in various raid encounters every second, allowing for
				better planning and survivability
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Story Behind Mr. Mythical</h2>
		<p class="mb-6">
			As a dedicated Mythic+ pusher and raid optimizer, I found myself juggling between various
			tools, spreadsheets, and community resources that didn't quite hit the mark. The constant
			tab-switching and data inconsistencies were frustrating, especially during key pushes or
			progression raids. That's when I decided to create MrMythical.com, a centralized platform that
			delivers exactly what players need, when they need it, without the clutter.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Development Philosophy</h2>
		<p class="mb-6">Three core principles guide the development of Mr. Mythical:</p>
		<ul class="mb-6 ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
			<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> All tools are regularly validated against in-game results</li>
			<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Fast, responsive interfaces that won't slow you down</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Simplicity:</strong> Clean, intuitive design without sacrificing functionality
			</li>
		</ul>
